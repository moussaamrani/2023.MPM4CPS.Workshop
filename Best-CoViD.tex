\section{Best Theme Paper + CoViD Measures}
\label{sec:Best}

\begin{description}
   \item[Best Theme Paper Selection] Depending on the number of submissions 
   related to the topics related to \#MDE4SG, the PC and Workshop Organisers 
   will have a special session after the regular reviewing process, if needed, 
   to nominate exactly one Best Paper that will be proposed as a candidate. 

   \item[CoViD Measures] We cumulated significant experience during the two 
   fully online previous editions: we can switch to full virtual immediately,
   assuming online support (Zoom/Whova) is available. A hybrid setting is 
   possible assuming some OC members are able to attend physically, and a streaming
   solution is available.
   
   We would try to preserve the afternoon brainstorming/discussion session if possible,
   but would remove it as well as one of the keynotes if necessary, and convert
   to a half-day event.
